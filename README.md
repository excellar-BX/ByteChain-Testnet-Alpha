# Explanation
ByteChain will consist of four phases of development which are:
**-ByteChain-Testnet-Alpha**,
**-ByteChain-Testnet-Beta**,
**-ByteChain-Testnet-Delta**,
**-ByteChain-Mainnet**

# ByteChain-Testnet-Alpha
This is the first testnet for ByteChain.
It is a JavaScript type BlockChain and it uses the Proof of Work consensus mechanism.


In the next phase ByteChain-Testnet-Beta will be explained fully and why it is different from ByteChain-Testnet-Alpha.
